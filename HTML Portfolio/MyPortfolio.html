    <p class="text_column">I came to Canada as a 2 year old from the Colombia. I have a family that has been inclined to the sciences and
    engineering and I am no different. I am fascinated by the applications of science, and creating things that are useful
    and functional. I have had 3 years of programming experience with java and with arduino programs. As of last year I
    begun work with 3D printers, designing on Solidworks and printing designs those unique designs. Recently I became very
    interested with programming, blockchain, and best of all investing in the stock market.
